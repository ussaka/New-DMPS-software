# New DMPS software

**Detectors**
- TSI CPCs, both old and new serial, pulse and TCP connections
- TSI electrometer
- Airmodus A20
- Airmodus PSM+A20
- Airmodus new model (A30?)
- Analog electrometers
- Also detector status should be saved

**DMA's**
- Vienna different lengths
- HalfMini
- TSI nano and long

**Blowers**
- Both analog control and pwm using TSI flow meter

**TSI flow meter**
- Flow, T and P
- Both 4000 and 5000 serie

**Analog signals**
- dP (flow), T, P, RH, HV monitor

**Stepping voltage and continous voltage scan (DMPS and SMPS)**

**PID control**
- Sheath flow? Or using microcontroller?
- HV control?
- Parallel script

**Inversion**
- Python inversion by Anton as module or stand alone old Fortran code from PasiA

**Parameters**
- *.INI-file
- Should have also a 'service mode' which allows to change the parameters from GUI.

**DAQ by NI**
- NI6211 & 6215

**Other features**
- Windows
- GUI
- Service mode as described above

PLAN
- Git
- Pasi's previous scripts are used
- Programmers: Hannu, Pasi, Kasperi,...(Pekka?)
- Pasi supervises Kasperi with the programming
- Hannu supervises Kasperi with hardware

SCHEDULE
- Let's start at week 21
- Summer holidays around mid summer and in July. Project should be in a good progress before that.
